# CSCI 2304 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Spring 2022, ADA University

I have taught Data Structures & Algorithms in Java at ADA University as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant under the supervision of Prof. Mykhailo Medvediev in Spring 2022.

In this repository, you can find the problems that I took from Leetcode and their solutions as well as explanations to solutions with comments.


Lecture 1: Recursion

Fibonacci Number problem is used to explain how Recursion works.

Link to the Fibonacci Number problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

v0 - Simple Recursion

v1 - Recursion Using Memorization with an Array

v2 - Recursion Using Memorization with a HashMap

v3 - Iteration

Note: Recursion is always equivalent to Iteration (at least, theoretically). Whatever you do with Recursion, you can also do with Iteration and vice versa.

Lecture 2: Stack

Valid Parentheses problem is used to explain how Stack works.

Lecture 3: Queue, Stack (Continued)

Implement Queue Using Stacks and Implement Stack Using Queues problems are used to explain how both Queue and Stack work.

Link to the Implement Queue Using Stacks problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Lecture 4: Linked List
