# CSCI 2304 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Spring 2022, ADA University

I have taught Data Structures & Algorithms in Java at ADA University as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant under the supervision of Prof. Mykhailo Medvediev in Spring 2022.

In this repository, you can find the problems that I took from Leetcode and their solutions as well as explanations to solutions with comments.


# Lecture 1: Recursion

Fibonacci Number problem is used to explain how Recursion works.

Link to the Fibonacci Number problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

v0 - Simple Recursion

v1 - Recursion Using Memorization with an Array

v2 - Recursion Using Memorization with a HashMap

v3 - Iteration

Note: Recursion is always equivalent to Iteration (at least, theoretically). Whatever you do with Recursion, you can also do with Iteration and vice versa.

# Lecture 2: Stack

Valid Parentheses problem is used to explain how Stacks work.

Link to the Valid Parentheses problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

# Lecture 3: Queue, Stack (Continued)

Implement Queue Using Stacks and Implement Stack Using Queues problems are used to explain how both Queues and Stacks work.

Link to the Implement Queue Using Stacks problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Link to the Implement Stack Using Queues problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/

# Lecture 4: Linked List

Merge Two Sorted Lists and Reverse Linked List problems are used to explain how Linked Lists work.

Link to the Merge Two Sorted Lists problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Link to the Reverse Linked List problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

# Lecture 5.1 Binary Search Tree (Intro)

Search in a Binary Search Tree and Range Sum of BST problems are used to explain how Binary Search Trees work.

Link to the Search in a Binary Search Tree problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/

Link to the Range Sum of BST problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/

# Lecture 5.2: Binary Search Tree (Traversals)

Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Binary Tree Preorder Traversal and Binary Tree Postorder Traversal problems are used to explain traversal algorithms on Binary Search Trees.

Link to the Binary Tree Inorder Traversal problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

Link to the Binary Tree Preorder Traversal problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/

Link to the Binary Tree Postorder Traversal problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/

Note: Each of the problems/traversal algorithms are implemented both recursively and iteratively which should show you the Equivalence of Iteration and Recursion.

# Lecture 6: Depth First Search

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree and Number of Islands problems are used to explain Depth First Search algorithm on unweighted graphs.

Link to the Maximum Depth of Binary Tree problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Link to the Number of Islands problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Note: Depth First Search algorithm does not always provide optimal solution, it may depending on the given input.

# Lecture 7: Breadth First Search

Binary Tree Level Order Traversal and Minimum Depth of Binary Tree problems are used to explain Breadth First Search algorithm on unweighted graphs.

Link to the Binary Tree Level Order Traversal problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Link to the Minimum Depth of Binary Tree problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/
