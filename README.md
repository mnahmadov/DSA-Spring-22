# CSCI 2304 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Spring 2022, ADA University

I have taught Data Structures & Algorithms in Java at ADA University as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Spring 2022.

In this repository, you can find the problems that I take from Leetcode and their solutions as well as explanations to solutions with comments.


Lecture 1: Recursion

Fibonacci Number problem is used to explain how Recursion works.

Link to the Fibonacci Number problem on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

v0 - Simple Recursion

v1 - Recursion Using Memorization with an Array

v2 - Recursion Using Memorization with a HashMap

v3 - Iteration

Note: Recursion is always equivalent to Iteration (at least, theoretically). Whatever you do with Recursion, you can also do with Iteration and vice versa.

Lecture 2: Stack

Valid Paranthesis problem is used to explain how Stack works.
